# C Programming Practice Repository

Welcome to the **C Programming Practice Repository** by [fazliddinorg](https://github.com/fazliddinorg).  
This repo contains beginner to intermediate-level C code examples and exercises to help strengthen your understanding of C programming concepts.

## üìÅ Project Structure

Each `.c` file in this repository focuses on a specific concept or feature in the C language:

| File Name           | Description                                     |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `hello.c`           | First "Hello, World!" program in C              |
| `variables.c`       | Basic variable declarations and data types      |
| `input_function.c`  | Reading user input using standard functions     |
| `conditionals.c`    | `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements           |
| `loops.c`           | Examples of `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops|
| `arrays.c`          | Working with 1D and 2D arrays                   |
| `pointers.c`        | Basics of pointers and memory addresses         |
| `malloc.c`          | Dynamic memory allocation using `malloc`       |
| `function.c`        | Function definitions, calls, and parameters     |
| `strings.c`         | Manipulating strings and character arrays       |
| `file_io.c`         | Reading from and writing to files in C          |
| `structs.c`         | Using `struct` to create custom data types      |

## ‚úÖ Goals

- Practice core C programming concepts
- Improve logic building and debugging skills
- Prepare for C-related interview questions or academic assessments

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Compile

Use `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection) to compile any file:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
````

Example:

```bash
gcc arrays.c -o arrays
./arrays
```

## üìå Requirements

* GCC compiler installed (Linux/macOS/WSL)
* A code editor (VSCode, Sublime Text, or even `vim`/`nano`)

## üìö Learning Resources

Some recommended resources while learning C:

* [The C Programming Language by Kernighan & Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)
* [Learn-C.org](https://www.learn-c.org/)
* [GeeksforGeeks C Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-language/)
